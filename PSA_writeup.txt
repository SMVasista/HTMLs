PSA - Partial Signal Amplification

To define a complex function composed as the sum of individial sub-functions. The average response (or global response) of the 
function can still hold true in the process of defining the complex function to change exponentailly and periodically is the condition
that the function generally gives a linear output for every perturbation of the individual variables. 
The global response is still restrained since the contribution of all the sub-functions vary exponentially while, 
making the global function quasi-linear.

Suppose F(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7...x30) is the global function where xi sub-function is defined as :

    xi = [k1i . s_xi/(k2i + s_xi)]
  
and the F = sum(xi) (i = 1,30 in the above case)
  
The fraction of xi sub-function on the global function is :
  
    c(xi) = xi/sum(xi) * 100 (in percentage)
  
Then, the average maximum for the functions set (maximizing c(xi) for i 1,30 in F=1F) : 1/i * 100

Which is for 30 sub-functions : 1/30 * 100 ~ 3.33% for any value of F (F' ~ 1000F also)

The objective is the increase the average maximum in the ideal case where the fraction of all sub-functions are equally
distributed.

define the following parameters: 
    
    <C> which is the average maximum fraction we need to achieve for the sub-functions
    n = number of nodes the F has to be divided to achieve the fraction
    I = Total number of sub-functions
    
So, n = I/<C>
    
    F' = sum(G(Fj) j in 1 to n)
    Fn = sum(xi) i in (n.I)
    
    G(Fj) = (Fj^n)
    
Illustration 1: For the above example of 30 sub-functions forming F,

  C ~ 3.33%
  Let the new <C> be = 10% ( <c> = 10 )

Hence, n = 30/10 = 3
functions per node h = 30/3 = 10

  F1 = sum(xi) i in 1,10
  F2 = sum(xi) i in 11,20
  F3 = sum(xi) i in 21,30

F' = sum(G(Fj)) = G(F1) + G(F2) + G(F3)
    = F1^3 + F2^3 + F3^3
    = (sum(xi))^3 + (sum(xj))^3 + (sum(xk))^3
    
Proof: 1 The c(xi) is ~ <C> for the condition that xi (i in 1,30) is equal

    Given that c(xi) is defined as xi/sum(xi) * 100, replace xi with xi^3
    
    for x(i) in node n, the average maximum of n is <C>node_local = xi/sum(xi)% = 1/10 * 100 = 10%
    
    therefore, for the function, F the <C(xi)> = <C>node_local * <C>node_global, where,
    
    <C>node_local = <C(xi)> and
    <C>node_global = fraction of node into the main function
    
    <C>node_global = Fn^3/sum(Fn)^3 * 100
    
    <C(xi)> =
